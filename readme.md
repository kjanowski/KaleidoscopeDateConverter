# About this project

The converters here are part of my worldbuilding project, the Kaleidoscope System.

Their primary purpose is to allow me to convert dates and times between the calendars that I am developing for my fictional cultures.

If you're interested in the lore behind these calendars, you can find more infomation here:

# License

You are free to adapt the converter logic for your own calendars, or add functionality such as leap years.
Therefore, I am placing the code under the [GNU General Public License 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).


However, this does *not* include the *worldbuilding concepts, art assets and my personal logo*.
Specifically excluded are the JSON files in the "config" folder, the images in the "img" subfolder and the file "style/theme_Kaleidoscope.css".
You can still use them as reference for creating your own version of these files.

# Technologies

This project uses basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
The only third-party technology is the embedding of additional fonts via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
